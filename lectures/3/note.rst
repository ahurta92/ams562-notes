======================

.. _lec3_arith_ops:

Elementary Arithmetic Operators
-------------------------------

For most :ref:`built-in types <lec1_builtin>` fundamental types, we have elementary operations
such as *addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, *division*, and *modulus*.

1. :code:`x+y`: the addition operator
2. :code:`+x` : unary plus
3. :code:`x-y`: the subtraction operator
2. :code:`+x` : unary minus
4. :code:`x*y`: the multiplication operator
5. :code:`x/y`: the division operator
6. :code:`%`: remainder (modulus) for integers  

.. note::

    1 and 2 can be also used as unary operators, i.e. represent *positive* and
    *negative*, respectively.

Be aware that the modulus operator only works for integers in `C++`_, this is
unlike `Python`_, where the operator is also applicable to floating numbers.

Example modulus_remainder.cpp
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: cpp

    int a = 5;
    std::cout << "mod(5,2)=" << 5%2;

    // std::cout << 5.0%2; // ERROR! % is not defined for floating numbers

Also, for the division operator, the behaviors for integers and floating
numbers are different.

Example truncation.cpp
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::cout << "5/2=" << 5/2; // this is 2
    std::cout << "5.0/2=" << 5./2; // this is 2.5

The resulting integers from dividing integers will be truncated. This is called
*integer division*.

.. note::

    The division is treated as *integer division* iff both left- and right-hand
    sides are integer types.

.. _lec3_assign_ops:

Assignment Operators
--------------------

So far, we have frequently been using the assignment operator, i.e. :code:`=`.
There are other types of assignment operators in `C++`_.

1. :code:`+=`: plus assignment
2. :code:`-=`: minus assignment
3. :code:`*=`: product assignment
4. :code:`/=`: quotient assignment
5. :code:`%=`: remainder assignment

There are so-called *compound assignment operators*, and you under these by the
following expression: :code:`A?=B` for :code:`?` :math:`\in`
:code:`{+,-,*,/,%}` is equivalent to :code:`A=A?B`.

Example assignment_operators.cpp
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


.. code-block:: cpp

    int a = 0;
    int b = 2;

    int c = a + b;
    c *= b; // c=c*2
    c -= b; // c=c-2
    c /= b; // c=c/2
    std::cout << "c = " << c << std::endl

.. _lec3_inc_dec_ops:

Increment & Decrement Operators
-------------------------------

In `C++`_, we also have increment and decrement operators for integers to
increase or decrease their values by 1.

1. :code:`++`: increment operator
2. :code:`--`: decrement operator

Use as Suffix
+++++++++++++

These operators can be used as suffixes, e.g.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int a = 0;
    a++; // a = a+1  postincrement
    std::cout << a; // print out 1

**Post- increment/decrement operators modify the value of the target object
after processing the current statement.**



Use as Prefix
+++++++++++++

These operators, of course, can be used as prefixes, e.g.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int a = 0;
    --a;  // preincrement
    std::cout << a; // print out -1


**Pre- increment/decrement operators modify the value of the target object
before processing the current statement.**

Example assignment_operators.cpp
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What will each line print out?


.. code-block:: cpp

    int a = 0;
    std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a = " << a++ << std::endl;
    std::cout << "a = " << ++a << std::endl

Example pre_increment.cpp
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What is the output of a, b, and c?

.. code-block:: cpp

  int a = 0;
  int b = --a;
  int c = 0;
  c = --a;

  // What will each operator print out?
  std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;
  std::cout << "b = " << b << std::endl;
  std::cout << "c = " << c << std::endl;

Example post_increment.cpp
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: cpp

  int a = 0;
  int b = a--;
  int c = 0;
  c = a--;

  // What will each operator print out?
  std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;
  std::cout << "b = " << b << std::endl;
  std::cout << "c = " << c << std::endl;

An Exercise increment_exercise.cpp
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Take a look at the following program:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    int i1 = 1;
    int i2 = ++i1;
    int i3 = ++ ++i1;
    int i4 = i1++;
    // we cannot do i1++ ++
    std::cout << "i1 = " << i1 << "\n"
              << "i2 = " << i2 << "\n"
              << "i3 = " << i3 << "\n"
              << "i4 = " << i4 << "\n";


.. _lec3_logic_ops:

Comparison & Logical Operations
-------------------------------

To compare two values, you need to use comparison operators in `C++`_:

1. :code:`x<y`: strictly less than
2. :code:`x>y`: strictly greater than
3. :code:`x<=y`: less than or equal to
4. :code:`x>=y`: greater than or equal to
5. :code:`x==y`: equal to
6. :code:`x!=y`: not equal to

The resulting object of the comparison operators are boolean flags, i.e. either
:code:`true` or :code:`false`.

For logical operators, we have:

1. :code:`x&&y`: logical and
2. :code:`x||y`: logical or
3. :code:`!x`: logical not (use as unary operator)
4. :code:`x&y`: bitwise and 
5. :code:`x|y`: bitwise or
6. :code:`x^y`: bitwise exclusive or
7. :code:`^x`: bitwise complement 

A bitwise logical operator yields the result of the operand type
for which the operation has been performed on each bit.

The logical :code:`&&` and :code:`||` returns true or false 
depending on the values of the operands. 

.. note::

    Technically speaking, :code:`^` is a bitwise operator not a logical
    operator. However, since ``true`` can be converted into integer 1 and
    0 for ``false``, and :code:`1^0=1`, :code:`1^1=0`, and :code:`0^0=0`,
    which behave exactly like an xor operation.

Example logical_operators0.cpp
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::cout << "1<2 and 2<3 is: " << (1<2 && 2<3);
    std::cout << "3==4 || 3==6/2 is: " << (3==4 || 3==6/2);
    std::cout << "not 1.0<0.0 is: " << (!(1.0<0.0));
    std::cout << "either 10>2 or 5>2 but not both: " << ((10>2)^(5>2));

Try out comparison and logical operators in :nblec_3:`logi_comp`.

Example logical_operators.cpp
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: cpp

  int a = -0b1011; // -11
  int c = 0b1000;  // 42944967285

  unsigned b = a;
  std::cout << "a  = " << a << std::endl;
  std::cout << "b  = " << b << std::endl;
  std::cout << "c  = " << c << std::endl;

  // and
  std::cout << "(a && b) = " << (a && b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "(a && c) = " << (a && c) << std::endl;

  // or
  std::cout << "(a || b) = " << (a || b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "(a || c) = " << (a || c) << std::endl;

  // comparision
  std::cout << "(a == b) = " << (a == b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "(a == c) = " << (a == c) << std::endl;
  // bitwise and
  std::cout << "(a & b) = " << (a & b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "(a & c) = " << (a & c) << std::endl;
  // bitwise or
  std::cout << "(a | b) = " << (a | b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "(a | c) = " << (a | c) << std::endl;
  // bitwise or
  std::cout << "(a | b) = " << static_cast<int>(a | b) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "(a | c) = " << static_cast<int>(a | c) << std::endl;

.. _lec3_common_math:

Common Mathematical Operations
------------------------------

As applied scientists who do programming, there is not doubt that using common
mathematical functions is necessary. Unlike `MATLAB`_, in which the common
mathematical functions are defined as built-ins, `C++`_ doesn't know how to
do math by default (sigh...). Fortunately, the *standard math library* provides
most common mathematical operations that can potentially become very handy.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <cmath>  // standard math interface

    ...

    std::cout << "sin(pi) is: " << std::sin(M_PI);
    std::cout << "cos(0) is: " << std::cos(0.0);
    std::cout << "arcsin(1) is: " << std::asin(1.0);
    std::cout << "log 2 of base 2 is: " << std::log2(2);
    std::cout << "|-1| is: " << std::abs(-1);

For a complete list and the usage, please refer to
`Standard library header <cmath> <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cmath>`_.

Try out this :nblec_3:`math`.

.. _lec3_ptr_arith:

Pointer Arithmetic
------------------

Again, pointers... `C++`_ allows you to perform arithmetic operations on
pointers. Of course, the means are different from
:ref:`the elementary arithmetic operations <lec3_arith_ops>`. You can add or
subtract an integer from a pointer, e.g.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    int obj[2];
    int *ptr = obj; // equiv to ptr = &obj[0]
    int *ptr_next = ptr+1;
    int *ptr_ori = ptr_next-1;

Here, adding one to ``ptr`` meaning that advance ``ptr`` to next memory address
thus resulting the next adjacent pointer, i.e. ``ptr_next``. Similarly, in line
4, subtracting one from a pointer meaning that move the pointer to its previous
adjacent position, i.e. ``ptr_ori``.

.. note::

    Adding/subtracting integers from a pointer result another pointer.

You can also subtract two pointers, e.g. :code:`ptr1-ptr2`. The result is an
integer that represents the *signed distance* between the two pointers.

.. code-block:: cpp

    float a[2];
    float *ptr_a = a, *ptr_b = ptr_a+1;
    std::cout << "distance in memory between a[0] and a[1] is: " << (ptr_a-ptr_b); // -1


:ref:`Increment and decrement operators <lec3_inc_dec_ops>` are also applicable
to pointers, i.e.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};  // an array of length 5
    int *ptr = arr;
    std::cout << *ptr; // 1
    std::cout << *ptr++; // 1, why??
    std::cout << *++ptr; // 3
    std::cout << *ptr--; // 3, where is ptr now?

Let's take a look at the code above. Line 1 and 2 define an array of size 5 and
initialize its value to :code:`{1,2,3,4,5}`, then define a pointer ``ptr`` that
points to the array.

Line 3 simply shows the value of :code:`arr[0]` by deferencing :code:`ptr`.
Line 4 will first prints the value of :code:`*ptr` then advances ``ptr`` to its
nest position, i.e. :code:`arr[1]`. Line 5 first advances ``ptr`` to
:code:`arr[2]` and displays its value.

For more, take a look at this :nblec_3:`ptr_arith`.

Control Statements
==================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :backlinks: top

A statement in `C++`_, roughly speaking, is a single line of code that ends
with semicolon, i.e. :code:`;`, which can be executed by the program.

Control statements are special statements in `C++`_ (or any other programming
languages) that control how/whether other statements will be executed. With
:ref:`my fundamental assumption <intro_fund>`, I will not go detail in the
concept of control statements. I will mainly focus on introducing the
syntax and giving examples.

.. note::

    It's probably a good idea to review the concept of
    :ref:`scope <lec1_scope>` in `C++`_.

In general, control statements in `C++`_ can be put into three families:

1. Conditional statements
2. Loop statements
3. Jump statements

.. _lec3_stm_cond:

Conditional Statements
----------------------

`C++`_ provides two control statements to perform conditional executions.

.. _lec3_stm_cond_if:

The :code:`if` Statement
++++++++++++++++++++++++

An :code:`if` statement conditionally execute another statement based on
whether or not a specified condition is ``true``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    if (<condition>) {
        // do things if <condition> is true
    }

For example:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    std::string dep;
    std::cout << "enter the department:";
    std::cin >> dep;
    if (dep == "ams") {
        std::string course;
        std::cout << "enter the class number:";
        std::cin >> course;
        std::cout << "welcome to ams" << course << std::endl;
    }

Line 4-9 will only be executed if the input ``dep`` is :code:`"ams"`. Compile
and run this program.

Of course, you can add ``else`` so that the condition is complete, the syntax
is:

.. code-block:: cpp

    if (<condition>) {
        // do things if <condition> is true
    } else {
        // do things if not <condition>
    }

For example:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    unsigned n;
    std::cout << "enter a non-negative whole number:";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::string odd_or_even;
    if (n%2) {
        odd_or_even = "odd";
    } else {
        odd_or_even = "even";
    }
    std::cout << "you just entered an " << odd_or_even << " number\n";

Multiple (more than 2) condition branches are supported with :code:`else if`
statement, the syntax is:

.. code-block:: cpp

    if (<condition1>) {
        // do things if <condition1> is true
    } else if (<condition2>) {
        // do things if <condition2> is true
    } else if (<condition3>) {
        // do things if <condition3> is true
    } else {
        // ow
    }

.. note::

    Multiple condition branches are executed in sequential order, and the
    statement will terminate til reach the first ``true`` case of the end of
    the ``if`` statement.

.. note::

    A :code:`if-else if-else if-...-else` is considered as a **single**
    statement!

Let's take a look at the following two different programs:

.. code-block:: cpp

    const int n = 2;
    int a;
    if (n == 2) {
        a = 100;
    } else if (n % 2 == 0) {
        a = 200;
    } else {
        a = 300;
    }
    std::cout << "a=" << a << std::endl;

What is the value of ``a``?

.. code-block:: cpp

    const int n = 2;
    int a;
    if (n == 2) {
        a = 100;
    }
    if (n%2 == 0) {
        a = 200;
    }
    if (n%2) {
        a = 300;
    }
    std::cout << "a=" << a << std::endl;

What about this one?

Command Line Inputs
```````````````````

So far, our :ref:`main <intro_simple_cpp_main>` functions are defined without
any input arguments. However, it's common to have ``argc`` and ``argv`` as the
function input parameters, i.e.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // main.cpp
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        return 0;
    }

Where ``argc`` is an integer and ``argv`` is an :ref:`array<lec1_array>` of
:ref:`C-strings <lec1_cstr>`. So what are the meanings of these variables?
``argc`` indicates the number of input arguments from command line when the
program is executed, and ``argv`` stores their values in raw strings.

For instance, you can :ref:`compile <intro_simple_cpp_compile>` the program
into an executable binary :code:`a.out` by:

.. code-block:: console

    $ g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp

Then, you can run the program by:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./a.out

Which means the command line arguments is :code:`./a.out`. In the program,
``argc`` is 1 and the first element (C-string) in ``argv``, i.e.
:code:`argv[0]`, stores the name of the executable---:code:`./a.out`.

.. note::

    All programs have at least one command line argument, which stores their
    names.

If you type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./a.out 1 2 3 abc

The program's ``argc`` is 5 with :code:`argv={"./a.out","1","2","3","abc"}`.

The functionality of command line inputs is important, because it enables
*batch processing* with user inputs.

.. note::

    In most cases, interactive inputs, e.g. through :code:`std::cin`
    and keyboards, are not possible, especially for scientific computing where
    programs usually run on clusters.

Now, combining this information with ``if`` statement, you can parse the user
command line inputs. In addition, it's common that you want the user to pass
some numerical values, so converting from C-strings to integral/floating
numbers is necessary. This can be done with the functions :code:`std::atoi`
and :code:`std::atof` that are defined in official :code:`<cstdlib>` library.

.. code-block:: cpp

    # include <cstdlib>

    ...

    const char * i_str = "4";
    const char * f_str = "1e-1";
    const int i = std::atoi(i_str);
    const double f = std::atof(f_str);
    // i is 4 and f is 0.1

.. hint::

    Check the number of input arguments by :code:`if (argc < 3) ...`

.. only:: html

    Compile and run :download:`cmd_inputs.cpp<../../programs/3/cmd_inputs.cpp>`.

.. only:: latex

    Compile and run :cpplec_3:`cmd_inputs`.

Writing Efficient :code:`if` Statement
``````````````````````````````````````

Make the condition branches that have large probability taking higher priority.

.. code-block:: cpp

    unsigned n;
    std::cin >> n;
    const unsigned rem = n%100;

    // prefer

    if (rem != 0) {
        // do work I
    } else {
        // do work II
    }

    // over

    if (rem == 0) {
        // do work II
    } else {
        // do work I
    }

.. _lec3_stm_cond_switch:

The :code:`switch` Statement
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Another conditional statement is :code:`switch`, which can be used to choose
one of the several integral expressions. Let's take a look at the following
example with a ``char`` as our integral expression.

.. code-block:: cpp

    char c;
    std::cin >> c;
    bool is_vowel = false;
    switch (c) {
    case 'a':
        is_vowel = true;
        break;
    case 'e':
        is_vowel = true;
        break;
    case 'i':
        is_vowel = true;
        break;
    case 'o':
        is_vowel = true;
        break;
    case 'u':
        is_vowel = true;
        break;
    }
    if (is_vowel) {
        // do something
    }

Each ``case`` is an entry point of the corresponding ``switch`` statement, and
**the statement will not terminate until it reaches the first break or the end
of the statement**. Therefore, the code above is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: cpp

    char c;
    std::cin >> c;
    bool is_vowel = false;
    switch (c) {
    case 'a':
    case 'e':
    case 'i':
    case 'o':
    case 'u':
        is_vowel = true;
        break;
    }
    if (is_vowel) {
        // do something
    }

.. warning::

    Missing ``break`` is a common bug in one's programs.

To make a complete condition, you need to use :code:`default`, which indicates
the default behavior. The ``is_vowel`` example can also be written as:

.. code-block:: cpp

    char c;
    std::cin >> c;
    bool is_vowel;
    switch (c) {
    case 'a':
    case 'e':
    case 'i':
    case 'o':
    case 'u':
        is_vowel = true;
        break; // missing this will make is_vowel always false
    default:
        is_vowel = false;
        break;
    }
    if (is_vowel) {
        // do something
    }

Play around with this :nblec_3:`switch`.

.. _lec3_stm_loop:

Loop Statements
---------------

Loop statements allow you to repeatedly execute some statements that follow
same/similar structure.

The :code:`for` Loop
++++++++++++++++++++

The :code:`for` loop in `C++`_ has the syntactic form:

.. code-block:: cpp

    for (<init statement>; <condition statement>; <express>) {
        // do work
    }

Each of the three blocks is separated by semicolon. The ``init statement``
will be invoked once. Here is what happens under the hood:

.. code-block:: cpp

    for (<init statement>; <condition statement>; <express>) {
        // if <init statement> has not been invoked, do it
        // if <condition statement> fails, stop

        // do work

        // invoke <express>
    }

With for loop, we can perform some simple operations with arrays. For instance,
you can initialize an array given the size is unknown.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int N;
    std::cin >> N;
    double *data = new double [N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        data[i] = 1.0;
    }
    delete [] data;

Or accumulate the value:

.. code-block:: cpp

    double sum(0.0);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        sum += data[i];
    }
    std::cout << "sum of data is: " << sum;
    std::cout << "average is: " << sum/N; // assume N>0

.. note::

    The counter ``i`` in the examples above has **local scope**.

You can, of course, define the counter out of the :code:`for` loop:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        // do work
    }

    // or

    int j = 0;
    for (; j < N; ++j) {
        // do work
    }

    // or
    int k = 0;
    for (; k < N; ) {
        // do work
        ++k;
    }

In fact, all three blocks can be empty (like line 9 and 15), even at the same
time (non-stopping loop), i.e.

.. code-block:: cpp

    for (;;) {}  // non-stopping...

`C++`_ doesn't restrict that the loop counter must be integers. Pointers
are another common counter.

.. code-block:: cpp

    for (double *data_ptr = data; data_ptr < data+N; ++data_ptr) {
        *data_ptr = 1.0;
    }

is equivalent to the first example in ``for`` loop section.

.. warning::

    Looping over floating numbers is not recommended and should be avoided,
    because it's expansive and problematic due to rounding errors.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // this is not preferred

    const double h = 1./3;
    double acc = 0.0;
    for (; acc < 100.0; acc += h) {
        // do work with acc
    }

    // do this instead

Implement a Forward Linked List with :code:`struct`
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In `C++`_, it's common that you want to group some data into a structure, in
this case, you can use :code:`struct`. The syntactic form is:

.. code-block:: cpp

    struct StructName {
        // any attributes
    }; // <-- don't forget the semicolon

For instance:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // you can represent a complex number by the following structure
    struct ComplexNumber {
        double real;
        double imag;
    };

Now, ``ComplexNumber`` is a customized type that is defined by the user. To
access an element/member in the structure, you need to use the accessing
operator :code:`.`, i.e.

.. code-block:: cpp

    ComplexNumber a, b; // two complex number
    a.real = 1.0;
    a.imag = -1.0;
    b.real = 2.0;
    b.imag = 1.0;

.. warning::

    ``ComplexNumber`` is not a built-in type, so you should not expect
    those arithmetic operations can be applied to it without any additional
    efforts. However, both ``real`` and ``imag`` are just ``double``.

You can, of course, define pointers that have base type ``ComplexNumber``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    ComplexNumber *ptr_a = &a, *ptr_b = &b;

To access the elements/members of a structure through its pointers, the
accessing operator :code:`->` is needed, i.e.

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::cout << "complex a=(" << ptr_a->real << ',' << ptr_a->imag << ")\n";
    // this prints out a=(1.0,-1.0)

Dynamic memory allocation is also applicable.

.. code-block:: cpp

    ComplexNumber *ptr = new ComplexNumber;
    ptr->real = 1.0;
    ptr->imag = 1.0;
    delete ptr;

    ComplexNumber *ptr_arr = new ComplexNumber[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        ptr_arr[i].real = 1.0;
        ptr_arr[i].imag = 2.0;
    }
    delete [] ptr_arr;

A linked list, like array, is another fundamental data structure. Unlike the
array, which has contiguous memory layout, a linked list can stay in arbitrary
locations in the memory, and each of its element (usually called node) points
to each other through pointers. A common structure for a node of linked list:

.. code-block:: cpp

    struct Node {
        int tag;
        Node *next;
    };

Notice that :code:`next` points to the next node in the linked list. Let's
implement a forward linked list with initialization, node insertion, and
finalization.

Now, open this :nblec_3:`for_fll`.

The :code:`while` Loop
++++++++++++++++++++++

The :code:`while` loop, like :code:`for`, is another iterative statement in
`C++`_. The syntax is:

.. code-block:: cpp

    while (<condition>) {
        <evaluate the condition>
        // do work
        <update conditional statement>
    }

You can easily translate a :code:`for` loop into a :code:`while` loop:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // for version
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cout << "i=" << i << ' ';
    }

    // while version
    int i = 0;
    while (i<n) {
        std::cout << "i=" << i << ' ';
        ++i; // what will happen if this statement is missing?
    }

Forward Linked List with :code:`while`
``````````````````````````````````````

We can also implement the :ref:`forward linked list <lec3_stm_loop_struct>`
with the :code:`while` loop.

Open this :nblec_3:`while_fll`.

The :code:`do-while` Loop
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The last loop statement is so-called :code:`do-while` in `C++`_. The syntactic
form is:

.. code-block:: cpp

    do {
        // do work
        <evaluate condition statement>
    } while (<condition>); // <- semicolon

:code:`while` vs. :code:`do-while`
``````````````````````````````````

**do-while guarantees that at least one statement will be evaluated**, e.g.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // while version
    while (false) {
        std::cout << "never executed\n";
    }

    // do-while version
    do {
        std::cout << "executed!\n";
    } while (false);

.. warning::

    As a result, it's easy to run into infinite loops with :code:`do-while`
    mechanism!

Pick the logic bugs in the following code:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // version 1
    unsigned n = 100u;
    do {
        n--;
    } while (n>=0u);

    // version 2
    unsigned n;
    std::cout << "enter an non-negative integer:";
    std::cin >> n;
    do {
        n--;
    } while (n>0u);

.. _lec3_stm_jump:

Jump Statements
---------------

The laster family of control statement is the *jump* statement. This is mainly
used to :code:`continue` a loop statement and/or :code:`break` it given the
fact that its conditional expression cannot be easily determined beforehand.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // skip statements if loop counter is odd
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i%2) {
            continue;
        }
        // do work
    }

In the code above, if ``i`` is odd, then the statement will be skipped.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // break a loop if the loop counter is 5
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i == 5) {
            break;
        }
        // do work
    }

In the code above, if ``i`` is 5, then the for loop will be terminated.

A practical example would be interactively talk with the user through
:code:`std::cin`.

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::string input;
    std::string buffer;
    while (true) {
        std::cout << "enter something:";
        std::cin >> input;
        if (input != "break") {
            std::cout << "you entered: "
                      << input
                      << ", the loop will continue\n";
            // clear the buffer in cin in case the user may enter more
            // than a word
            std::getline(std::cin, buffer);
            continue;
        } else {
            std::cout << "bye!\n";
            break;
        }
    }
