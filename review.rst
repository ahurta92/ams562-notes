Classes
==========================================================

- Classes represent concepts in a program
  - If you can think of "it" as a separate entity, its plausible that it can be made into a class
  - Vector, Matrix, input stream, string, FFT, graph, box, clock
- A class is a (user-defined) `type`

C++ allows for abstraction mechanisms that let programmers design and implements their own types.
The types built out of other types using C++ abstraction mechanisms are called user-defined types.
They are referred to as classes.  User-defined types are preferred over built-in types because
they are easier to use, less error-prone.


Introducing *Object-Oriented Programming* (OOP), ``class``
==========================================================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :backlinks: top

One of the main differences between C and C++ is that the latter is an object-oriented programming
(OOP) language, which means models are organized around objects instead of actions.
Traditionally, programs are written so that data and the operations done on data are separate.
In these types of programs allocating data can be easy, but defining the complex actions on top of it is hard.

Creating user-defined types allows us to link the data with how the data can be used.
For example, by defining types, we can distinguish between the interface
(aka how all users are allowed to use a class) and its implementation.
This makes writing programs more intuitive and reading our programs easier.

The fact is that when solving problems, we care about objects, not arbitrary data.
For instance, each student has a unique school ID, which can be represented as an integer or a string.
However, such a raw data type has no meaning and is thus useless; the “ID” data only becomes meaningful
when it couples with the corresponding student, which can be viewed as an object.
In OOP, an ``object`` is a user-defined model that can contain both data ( a.k.a. fields/attributes/members)
and code (a.k.a. methods/member functions).

.. note::

    One of the nice feature of OOP is that it allows people to fit the
    programming language into their problems.

The data and code usually are only applicable to the object itself and this
makes the programming cleaner and nicer.

The Basics
-----------

Personally, the first step of doing OOP in `C++`_ is to think through your
problems and structure the design of objects. (This is the most challenging
part in OOP!)

For instance, let's keep thinking of the example of ``Student``. Each student
has:

1. a name: first/last and (or) middle names,
2. sex: male, female, or other,
3. type: undergraduate, master, or doctoral,
4. status: in what year is this student in, and
5. ID number.

These will be the members of ``Student``, and their corresponding data types
are:

1. name: ``std::string``,
2. sex: ``int`` or ``std::string``,
3. type: ``int`` or ``std::string``,
4. status: ``int`` or ``std::string``, and
5. ID number: ``int`` or ``std::string``.

Now, let's group everything into a ``class``, which is conceptually and
syntactically close to :ref:`struct <lec3_stm_loop_struct>`.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Student {
        std::string name;
        std::string sex;
        std::string type;
        std::string status;
        long id;
    }; // semi-colon

Now, we want to create a student named Joe Chang.

.. code-block:: cpp

    Student joe;
    joe.name = "Joe Chang"; // ERROR!

However, this will not work, the following error will be thrown:

    error: 'std::__cxx11::string Student::name' is private within this context

The reason is that we don't have "permission" to access the ``name`` member in
``Student`` due to "incorrect" *accessing specifiers*.

.. _lec6_class_basis_access:

In `C++`_, each content of a ``class`` object is associated with one of the
following accessing specifiers: ``public``, ``private``, and ``protected``
(future).

``public`` Access
+++++++++++++++++

A public access of a member or a member method is to allow it to be used from
outside of a class by any other functions/classes. To make the above example
work, we can simply do:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Student {
    public:
        std::string name;
        std::string sex;
        std::string type;
        std::string status;
        long id;
    }; // semi-colon

Then, all of ``name``, ``sex``, ``type``, ``status``, and ``id`` are exposed
to outside thus modifying their values is valid.

.. code-block:: cpp

    Student joe;
    joe.name = "Joe Chang"; // Okay

.. note::

    ``struct``, by default, grants all its contents with ``public`` accessing
    permission.

``private`` Access
++++++++++++++++++

In contract to ``public`` accessing, contents with ``private`` accessing
specifier only allows to be accessed inside the class. By "inside", it means
that a ``private`` member can be only modified by other member functions.

.. note:: By default, all contents in a ``class`` are ``private``.

Remarks Regarding ``public`` & ``private``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Typically, `C++`_ prefers to have all data attributes under ``private``
specifier and modify them through ``public`` member functions (later). To
distinguish between ``public`` and ``private`` contents, usually, people
define some consistent naming schemes of the variables.

.. tip::

    Personally, I like to either append an "_" either in front of or at the
    end of ``private`` members.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Student {
    private:
        std::string _name;  // append front _ to indicate private
    };

.. _lec6_basis_con_de:

Constructors & Destructors
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When we create an object, the object's *constructor* will be called. And when
the object reaches its end of life, `C++`_ provides a mechanism called
*destructor* that will be invoked. `C++`_ generates a *default constructor*,
a *copy constructor* and a *destructor* for every class been defined.

.. note::

    The reason of the existence of the former two is that, by default, `C++`_
    must guarantee every user-defined object can be constructed and copied.

You can, of course, overwrite the three class "built-ins".

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Student {
    public:
        // default constructor
        Student() {
            // if you don't define this, then all the
            // members will have default values of string
            // and long
            name = "NA";
            id = -1;
        }

        // copy constructor
        Student(const Student &other) {
            // by default, it this is not given, then
            // all attributes will copy the corresponding entries
            // in "other".
            id = other.id;
            name = other.name;
            sex = other.sex;
            type = other.type;
            status = other.status;
        }

        // destructor
        ~Student() {
            std::cout << "destructor called!\n"
        }

        std::string name;
        std::string sex;
        std::string type;
        std::string status;
        long id;
    };

Some remarks:

1.
    Constructors are "member function" like except that the function name must
    be the object name and there is no return type.

2.
    Destructors are also function-like w/o return types, in addition, a prefix
    ``~`` must be written.

.. code-block:: cpp

    {
        Student joe;
        // what is the following output
        std::cout << joe.name << ':' << joe.id << '\n';

        joe.id = 123;
        joe.sex = "male";
        joe.type = "master";
        joe.status= "G1";

        Student joe_copy(joe); // invoke copy constructor

        // what about this?
        std::cout << joe_copy.type << ':' << joe_copy.status << '\n';
    } // destructor called here!

To better understanding constructors and destructors, I **strongly** encourage
you look at the :nblec_6:`constr-destr`.

More on Constructors
++++++++++++++++++++

Of course, you are not limited on only have the default and copy constructors,
to write your own constructors of an object, the following two rules, of which
you need to keep in mind:

1. Defining constructors is like defining functions **without** return types.
2. The "function" name must be the name of the object.

The rest are just parameter list that you want to enable to the object
construction interface.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Student {
    public:
        // constructor with student name
        Student(const std::string &nm) {
            name = nm;
        }

        // constructor with student name and ID
        Student(const std::string &nm, long ID) {
            name = nm;
            id = ID;
        }

        // constructor with all information
        Student(const std::string &nm,
                const std::string &s,
                const std::string &tp,
                const std::string &st,
                long ID) {
            name = nm;
            sex = s;
            type = tp;
            status = st;
            id = ID;
        }

        std::string name;
        std::string sex;
        std::string type;
        std::string status;
        long id;
    };

Then, in the main program, you can use these constructors as:

.. code-block:: cpp

    Student s1; // default constructor
    Student s2("Jane"); // constructor with name
    Student s3("Chow", 1220033); // constructor with name and ID
    Student s3_cp(s3); // copy constructor
    Student s4("Mike",
               "male",
               "master",
               "G1",
               1234567890); // the "complete" version

Implicit Construction
`````````````````````

For **single** parameter constructors, by default, `C++`_ assumes the
constructors are *implicit* meaning that the object can be constructed by
converting from the single input parameter. In the ``Student`` example, the
constructor with only name parameter is implicit.

.. code-block:: cpp

    Student se("Foo Bar"); // explicit construction
    Student si = "Spam Eggs"; // implicit construction

If we use parentheses, the construction is explicit, the assignment is for
implicit construction. Well, you may feel like this is not important, since
it makes you feel like it's just a way how people prefer to construct objects.
However, the critical difference is
:ref:`function argument passing <lec4_func_pass>`.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // an demo interface function that takes student as input
    void interface(const Student &stdt) {
        std::cout << stdt.name << std::endl;
    }

As you can see, the function takes a ``Student`` as input, but because of the
conversion between ``std::string`` and ``Student`` is given by the implicit
construction process through ``Student::Student(const std::string &nm)``,
this function can also takes ``std:string`` as input!

.. code-block:: cpp

    Student s("Foo Bar");
    interface(s);

    // This is also allowed! The reason is that the input string
    // "Spam Eggs" will be implicitly converted to a Student object.
    interface("Spam Eggs");

Explicit Construction
`````````````````````

There is not really an answer to whether allowing implicit constructor is good
or not. In certain cases, it's nice and provide users a more flexible
constructor interfaces. However, at the same time, it's hard to debug the code.

`C++`_, with this consideration, provides a keyword ``explicit`` so that the
implicit-ness of a constructor can be disabled.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Student {
    public:
        // explicit constructor with student name
        explicit Student(const std::string &nm) {
            name = nm;
        }
        ... // data members
    };

Now, if you try to call the ``interface`` function with a string input, you
will get a compilation error.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // interface("Spam Eggs"); // ERROR! string cannot be converted to Student

To have a better understanding of explicit/implicit constructors, please look
at :nblec_6:`imp_ex`.

Member Functions
++++++++++++++++

As we have already mentioned, an object in OOP language is not limited to only
hold data attributes, it can also contain code or, in other words, member
functions, which are a group of functions that only work for this type of
objects.

The ``this`` Pointer
````````````````````

We have already seen functions like:

.. code-block:: cpp

    struct MyStruct {...};
    void method(const MyStruct &obj, ...); // method for accessing obj
    void method(MyStruct &obj, ...); // method for modifying obj

.. note:: The function ``method`` above is overloaded.

Conceptually, this kind of functions are considered to be "member functions"
of ``MyStruct`` because it can only work for ``MyStruct``. With `C++`_ classes,
you can define member functions inside the class definition (just like data
attributes, which we have seen previously). Let's look at the following
example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class MyClass {
    public:
    void method();
    };

To call it, just access the member functions like data attributes:

.. code-block:: cpp

    MyClass obj;
    obj.method();

**Question: how many input argument(s) does method have?**

Well, intuitively, you may say zero, and this is what we have learned in the
:ref:`function <lec4>` lecture. However, the correct answer is **one**.

If the input is zero, how does ``method`` know that it belongs to
``MyClass`` ;). What happens under the hood is that for each of the member
functions, a ``this`` pointer is passed in as the actual first input argument.
The ``this`` pointer has type of the object, in this case ``MyClass``.

.. note::

    For those who come from `Python`_, ``this`` == ``self``. The only
    difference is that ``this`` is transparent.

.. _lec6_class_bs_generic:

Personally, I suggest that to better understanding member functions, let's
Introduce a concept called *generic member function interface*. The ``method``
function has a generic interface of:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Notice that no constant qualifier
    void MyClass::method(MyClass *this);

.. warning::

    The generic interfaces are just for demonstrations purpose, they are not
    legal `C++`_ syntax!

Now, let's convert the following member functions to their generic interfaces.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class MyClass {
    public:
    void set_value() {
        // we can explicitly use this to access a
        this->_a = 0;
    }
    // overload!
    void set_value(int a) {
        // we can omit this, which is typically
        // what ppl do in practice
        _a = a;
    }
    void copy(const MyClass &other) {
        _a = other._a; // within class definition, we can access _a!
    }

    private:
    int _a; // give some data for demo
    };

Remarks:

1.
    Now, you should understand that the meaning of ``private`` accessing.
    ``_a`` can only be accessed by ``MyClass`` during defining the
    interfaces.

2.
    Because of using ``this`` is optional, we have a "convention" that to
    use special pattern to indicate private data attributes.

The corresponding generic interfaces (not legal `C++`_ syntax!) are:

.. code-block:: cpp

    void MyClass::set_value(MyClass *this) {
        this->_a = 0;
    }
    void MyClass::set_value(MyClass *this, int a) {
        this->_a = a;
    }
    void MyClass::copy(MyClass *this, const MyClass &other) {
        this->_a = other._a;
    }

.. note::

    Like ``private`` data attributes, you can also have ``private`` member
    functions.

``const`` Member Functions
``````````````````````````

All the member functions we have defined so far can be only used without
``const`` qualifier.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void call_myClass(const MyClass &obj) {
        // ERROR! because set_value passes MyClass * in
        // not const MyClass *
        // and the const qualifier applied to obj will
        // automatically affect all its member functions/attributes
        obj.set_value();
    }

Intuitively, we know that the generic interface of member function with
``const this`` should be:

.. code-block:: cpp

    void MyClass::method(const MyClass *this, ...);

This is correct, but how to indicate that ``this`` has ``const`` qualifier?
`C++`_ requires you to append ``const`` to the end of any member functions to
indicate that these member functions use ``const this``; member functions with
``const this`` are referred as *constant member functions*.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    class MyClass {
    public:
        ... // set methods
        // typically, get method should have constant qualifier
        int get_value() const {
            // or this->_a
            return _a;
        }
    private:
        int _a;
    };

The ``const`` qualifier in line 4 indicates that the first input argument of
``get_value`` is ``const MyClass *this``.

.. tip::

    The general rules can be also applied here, i.e. use ``const`` whenever
    possible for member functions.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void print(const MyClass &obj) {
        std::cout << obj.get_value();
    }
    MyClass obj;
    obj.set_value(100);
    print(obj);

If ``get_value`` is not constant member function, the we cannot call it inside
the ``print`` *free function*.

.. note::

    *free functions* are simply not member functions, i.e. they belong to
    no specific classes.

Defining Member Functions
`````````````````````````

To separate the interfaces and implementations, we need to know how to define
constructors, destructors, and member functions outside of the class.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // in MyClass.hpp

    // we only declare the member functions
    // inside the class definition
    class MyClass {
    public:
        // explicit constructor
        explicit MyClass(int a);

        // set value
        void set_value(int a);

        // get value
        int get_value() const;
    private:
        int _a;
    };

To define these functions and the constructor, we need to indicate `C++`_ that
these methods are not *free*, they belong to ``MyClass``. We need to use
the scope accessor operator :code:`::` (we have seen this in ``namespace``).

.. code-block:: cpp

    // in MyClass.cpp

    #include "MyClass.hpp"

    // explicit can only be used inside class!
    MyClass::MyClass(int a) {
        _a = a;
        // or this->_a = a;
    }

    void MyClass::set_value(int a) {
        _a = a;
    }

    void MyClass::get_value() const {
        return _a;
    }

.. warning:: ``explicit`` can only be specified inside class definition!

.. _lec6_class_bs_cmplx:

The ``ComplexNumber`` Class
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's define a complex number class by using all the techniques we have learned
so far. First a complex number associates with a real and an imaginary
components thus the class data attributes should only have two floating
numbers.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    class ComplexNumber {
    private:
        double _real, _imag; // real and imaginary parts
    };

Now, we want to overwrite the :ref:`default constructor <lec6_basis_con_de>`
so that we can control the default behaviors of ``_real`` and ``_imag`` when
users create default complex numbers.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 3-6

    class ComplexNumber {
    public:
        ComplexNumber() {
            _real = 0.0;
            _imag = 0.0;
        }
    private:
        double _real, _imag; // real and imaginary parts
    };

We want to customize a constructor so that it can take input doubles. In
addition, we want to make the imaginary has default value 0. In addition, we
want to implement a helper function for printing the values.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4-13

    class ComplexNumber {
    public:
        ...
        // constructor with two doubles, note that we don't
        // mark explicit, so that double can be converted to ComplexNumber
        ComplexNumber(double real, double imag = 0.0) {
            _real = real;
            _imag = imag;
        }
        // implement a helper function for printing
        void print() const {
            std::cout << "real=" << _real << ", imag=" << _imag << '\n';
        }
    private:
        double _real, _imag; // real and imaginary parts
    };

.. note::

    The constructor above an be used to implicitly convert a ``double`` into
    a ``ComplexNumber`` by assigning the ``double`` as the real part and make
    the imaginary component zero.

Now, let's think about some member functions. We want to provide the following
functionalities for ``ComplexNumber``:

1. setting/getting real & imaginary parts,
2. copying other ``ComplexNumber`` numbers,
3. making a copy of "myself", i.e. ``this``,
4. computing the conjugate/modulus, and
5. adding/subtracting complex numbers.

Set/Get Values
``````````````

Of course, we can do the traditional set/get for bullet 1, like what we did
for ``MyClass``, but a neat way is to utilize
:ref:`function overloading <lec4_func_adv_ov>`.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4-11

    class ComplexNumber {
    public:
        ...
        // real returns the normal reference to _real
        double &real() { return _real; }
        // this one is overloaded to return a copy of real
        double real() const { return _real; }

        // similarly for imag
        double &imag() { return _imag; }
        double imag() const { return _imag; }
    private:
        double _real, _imag; // real and imaginary parts
    };

Why ``real`` and ``imag`` are considered as function overloading? Well, let's
take a look at their generic interfaces:

.. code-block:: cpp

    double &ComplexNumber::real(ComplexNumber *this);
    double ComplexNumber::real(const ComplexNumber *this);
    double &ComplexNumber::imag(ComplexNumber *this);
    double ComplexNumber::imag(const ComplexNumber *this);

Since they are differ **not only in return type**, they are valid overloaded
functions.

**Question: what if we don't have constant qualifier in the second versions?**

With this interfaces, you can do:

.. code-block:: cpp

    ComplexNumber a(1.0, 1.0);
    // which real/imag are called?
    a.real() = 2.0;
    a.imag() = -1.0;
    // what about the following two?
    std::cout << "real=" << a.real();
    std::cout << "imag=" << a.imag();

.. note:: ``std::cout`` only accepts objects with constant qualifier.

Copy & Make Copies
``````````````````

Similarly, we utilize :ref:`function overloading <lec4_func_adv_ov>` for
implementing these two functionalities.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4-11

    class ComplexNumber {
    public:
        ...
        // make a copy
        // because we won't modify this, make it constant
        ComplexNumber copy() const {
            // what is the type of *this? and what constructor is called?
            ComplexNumber tmp(*this);
            return tmp;
            // or return *this; // do you get it?
        }
    private:
        double _real, _imag; // real and imaginary parts
    };

And copy other complex numbers:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4-8

    class ComplexNumber {
    public:
        ...
        // copy other values, no constant qualifier
        void copy(const ComplexNumber &other) {
            _real = other._real;
            _imag = other._imag;
        }
    private:
        double _real, _imag; // real and imaginary parts
    };

Compute Conjugate and Modulus
`````````````````````````````

Given a complex number with *Euler form*, i.e. :math:`z=x+yi`, where :math:`i`
is the *imaginary unit*, i.e. :math:`i=\sqrt{-1}`. Then, the modulus of
:math:`z` is:

.. math::

    \left\vert z\right\vert&=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}

and the conjugate is:

.. math::

    \bar{z}&=x-yi

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4-11

    class ComplexNumber {
    public:
        ...
        // modulus, require <cmath>
        double modulus() const {
            return std::sqrt(_real*_real+_imag*_imag);
        }
        // conjugate
        ComplexNumber conj() const {
            return ComplexNumber(_real, -_imag);
        }
    private:
        double _real, _imag; // real and imaginary parts
    };

Add/Subtract ``ComplexNumber``
``````````````````````````````

Given complex numbers :math:`z_1` and :math:`z_2`, their addition and
subtraction are:

.. math::

    z_1+z_2&=\left(x_1+x_2\right)+\left(y_1+y_2\right)i

    z_1-z_2&=\left(x_1-x_2\right)+\left(y_1-y_2\right)i

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4-11

    class ComplexNumber {
    public:
        ...
        // add, i.e. this+rhs
        ComplexNumber add(const ComplexNumber &rhs) const {
            return ComplexNumber(_real+rhs.real(), _imag+rhs.imag());
        }
        // subtract, i.e. this-rhs
        ComplexNumber sub(const ComplexNumber &rhs) const {
            return ComplexNumber(_real-rhs.real(), _imag-rhs.imag());
        }
    private:
        double _real, _imag; // real and imaginary parts
    };

Usages:

.. code-block:: cpp

    ComplexNumber z1(1.0); // what is z1.imag()?
    ComplexNumber z2(2.0, -1.0);

    // tmp vars can call constant member functions

    // what is the value?
    z1.add(z2).print();

    // can we do this? answer: yes, but why?
    z1.add(3.0).print();

    z2.sub(z1).print(); // what about this?

Put Everything Together
```````````````````````

The overall implement can be found in :nblec_6:`complex` including some
usage codes.

In addition, the :ziplec_6:`complex` contains the header ``ComplexNumber.hpp``,
the source ``ComplexNumber.cpp`` and a main program for testing. This is a good
exercise for you to understand how to separate declarations and implementations
with classes.

The ``Array`` Class
+++++++++++++++++++

Another good starting example for understanding classes in `C++`_ is ``Array``,
which involves a great usage of the destructor.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Array {
    private:
        double *_data;   // memory
        unsigned _size;  // length of the array
    };

You probably hate :ref:`dynamic memory management <lec2_dyn>` (same do I)! One
obvious advantage of using the constructors and destructor of a class is that
you just need to implement :code:`new/delete` and/or :code:`new[]/delete[]`
once and `C++`_ will, then, automatically handle dynamic memory for you.

Therefore, for the ``Array`` class, you need to allocate memory inside the
constructors and relax it in the destructor, i.e. :code:`~Array::Array()`.
Another important point is the copy constructor, be default, if you don't
explicitly provide a copy constructor, then `C++`_ will assume the default
behavior, i.e. copy ``_data`` and ``_size`` accordingly. However, what you may
want is to implement a *deep copy*, so that whenever the copy constructor is
invoked, it's guaranteed that a new ``_data`` is allocated and the values are
copied.

.. hint::

    When you implement the copy constructor, ``new`` the ``_data`` based on
    the size of ``other``. Then copying the values by using an
    :ref:`iterative statement <lec3_stm_loop>`.

Here you can find the interface I have defined for ``Array``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Array {
    public:
        // default constructor
        Array();

        // copy constructor
        Array(const Array &other);

        // constructor with array size and
        explicit Array(unsigned n, double v = 0.0);

        // we want to overwrite the implicit destructor
        ~Array();

        // get the length of array
        unsigned size() const;

        // get the data pointer of array
        double *data();

        // get read-only pointer of array
        const double *data() const;

        // given a rhs Array, copy its value
        void copy(const Array &rhs);

        // reference entry "index" of the data
        double &at(unsigned index);

        // read-only reference entry "index" of the data
        const double &at(unsigned index) const;

        // resize the array
        void resize(unsigned new_size, bool prsv = true);

        // some math functions
        // L-2 norm, sum, maximum/minimum, and dot (inner) products
        double norm() const;
        double sum() const;
        double max() const;
        double min() const;
        double dot(const Array &rhs) const;

        // addition: this+rhs, return a new array
        Array add(const Array &rhs) const;

        // subtraction: this-rhs, return a new array
        Array sub(const Array &rhs) const;

        // do some terminal printing
        void print() const;

    private:
        double *_data;   ///< data pointer
        unsigned _size;  ///< length of the array
    };

Implement ``Array`` based on this interface and test your work. You can find
a more detailed version in :ziplec_6:`array` and the corresponding
:nblec_6:`array`.

Operator Overloading
--------------------

``class`` in `C++`_ helps us to cluster the data and well organize the relation
between our problems and the actual implementations. However, there are still
techniques that can make our life even nicer.

Recall the :ref:`complex numer <lec6_class_bs_cmplx>` example, while you read
through the lecture notes, you probably have some of the following thinkings:

1. "It would be really nice to have ``a = b`` instead of ``a.copy(b)``."
2. "It would be great to write ``z3 = z1+z2`` instead of ``z3.copy(z1+z2)``."
3. "I like :code:`std::cout << z1;` instead of doing ``z1.print()``."

"But can I do this??"

Yes! `C++`_ allows you to overload certain existing :ref:`operators <lec3_ops>`
for your own classes.

Unary Operators & Binary Operators
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We have learned the concepts of *unary* and *binary* operators in
:ref:`lecture 3 <lec3>`. Here, let's do a quick review.

Unary operators are those applied as *prefix* of objects, e.g. not, negative,
:ref:`address-of, deference <lec2_ptr>`, etc.

Binary operators are those applied between *left-hand sides* and
*right-hand side*, e.g. plus, minus, etc.

Overload-able Operators
+++++++++++++++++++++++

In `C++`_, most commonly used operators can be overloaded, such as ``+``,
``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``%``, ``=``, ``+=``, ``-=``, ``*=``, ``/=``, ``<<``,
``>>``, ``&&``, ``||``, ``!``, ``++``, ``--``, ``()``, ``[]``, etc.

For a complete list, please read `the cppreference web page <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators>`_.

Overloading Operators as Free and Member Functions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

    Operators in `C++`_ are nothing but just functions. Therefore, overloading
    operators is nothing but :ref:`overloading functions <lec4_func_adv_ov>`.

Declaring an operator overloading is just like declaring free/member functions.

For Unary Operators
```````````````````

Given a unary operator ``@``, i.e. ``@obj`` where ``obj`` is some object. To
declare operator overloading of it as **free** function:

    Obj operator @ (obj);

as **member** function:


    Obj operator @ ();

For the latter case, recall the concept of
:ref:`the generic interface <lec6_class_bs_generic>`, you know that ``this``
is passed in thus, conceptually, equivalent to the free function version.

For example, we want to declare the negative operator for class ``Obj``:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Obj {
    public:
        // as member function, this is implicitly pass in
        Obj operator-() const;
    };
    // as free function
    Obj operator-(const Obj &obj);

    // in main.cpp
    Obj a;
    // you can do -a
    -a;
    // or use as a function style
    a.operator-(); // if defined as member method
    operator-(a); // if defined as free method

For Binary Operators
````````````````````

Given a binary operator ``@``, i.e. ``lhs@rhs`` where ``lhs`` and ``rhs`` are
some objects (with potentially different types). To declare operator
overloading of it as a **free** function:

    Obj operator @ (lhs, rhs)

as a **member** function:

    Obj operator @ (rhs)

For the latter case, ``this`` is treated as the left-hand side.

For instance, to add addition operator ``+`` to ``Obj``, we need:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Obj {
    public:
        // as member function
        Obj operator+(const Obj &rhs) const; // const member function!
    };
    // as free function
    Obj operator+(const Obj &lhs, const &Obj &rhs);

    // in main function
    Obj lhs, rhs;
    // neat way
    lhs+rhs;
    // or as a function fashion
    lhs.operator+(rhs); // member
    operator+(lhs, rhs); // free

See the :cpplec_6:`binary_vs_unary` for a better understanding.

Assignment & Compound Assignments
`````````````````````````````````

For :ref:`assignment and compound assignment operators <lec3_assign_ops>`, they
are considered as binary operators and **MUST** be overloaded as member
methods. There are, in general, two ways to implement it:

**return void**:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Obj {
    public:
        // assignment
        void operator=(const Obj &obj) {
            // typically, copy the data of obj
        }
    };

vs. **return reference**:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Obj {
    public:
        // assignment
        Obj &operator=(const Obj &obj) {
            // typically, copy the data of obj
            return *this; // and return the reference of "myself"
        }
    };

For most assignment operations, there is no difference between this two
implementations, i.e.

.. code-block:: cpp

    Obj a, b;
    a = b;
    // or
    a.operator=(b);

However, the latter enables so-called *chain reaction* of assignment operators:

.. code-block:: cpp

    Obj a, b, c;

    // we want to copy c to both a and b
    // for return void version, we have to do it one by one
    a = c;
    b = c;
    // the reason is that
    a.operator=(c); // void is returned

    // for reference return, the chain reaction is
    a = b = c;
    // neat right? What happens under the hood is that
    a.operator=(b.operator=(c));
    // b.operator=(c) also returns an Obj that can be kept passing in to
    // a's operator=

.. note::

    The chain reaction is enabled for built-in types, e.g. ``a=b=c=d=1`` given
    integers ``a``, ``b``, ``c`` and ``d``.

See the :nblec_6:`chain_assign` for more.

.. _lec6_adv_class_io:

Output/Input Operators Overloading
``````````````````````````````````

In :ref:`this first lecture <lec1>`, we have learned the how to deal with
:ref:`standard I/O <lec1_io>`. Good news is that we can overload the input
operator :code:`>>` and output operator :code:`<<`. **But these operators must
be overloaded as free functions.**

The syntax to overload output operator is:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <iostream>

    std::ostream & operator<<(std::ostream &out, const Obj &obj);

As you can see, the interface takes a *generic* output streamer,
i.e. ``out`` with type :code:`std::ostream`, and outputs its reference. So that
you can enable the chain reaction of the output operator.

To implement it, you basically need to write contents to the output streamer
and return it at the end.

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::ostream & operator<<(std::ostream &out, const Obj &obj) {
        out << "obj";
        return out; // must return!
    }

    // in main program
    Obj obj1, obj2;
    std::cout << obj1 << ' ' << obj2;
    // this prints "obj obj" w/o quotations

The exact same logic can be applied on the input operator ``>>``. The syntax is

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::istream & operator>>(std::istream &in, Obj &obj) {
        // write things to input streamer
        // in >> ...
        return in;
    }

Where :code:`std::istream` is the *generic* input stream type.

Take a look at :cpplec_6:`ovld_io`.

Overloading :code:`[]` & :code:`()`
```````````````````````````````````

In practice, these two operators are commonly overloaded. The former can be
considered as the "accessing" operator and the latter can be used as
"callable" operator.

.. note:: These two operators must be overloaded as member methods.

Essentially, these two operators enable your classes by :code:`obj[...]` and
:code:`obj(...)`. One major difference is that the former can only accept
a **single** input parameter, while unlimited number of parameters can be used
in overloading :code:`()`.

.. note::

    The reason I like to reference :code:`()` as "callable" operator is that it
    allows you to make your objects behave like functions. This is so-called
    *functors* in `C++`_, which we will cover in the future.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // create a 2by2 matrix
    class Matrix22 {
    public:
    Matrix22() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
            _data[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // overload []
    double &operator[](int i) { return _data[i]; }
    const double &operator[](int i) const { return _data[i]; }

    // overload ()
    double &operator()(int row, int col) { return _data[2*row+col]; }
    const double &operator()(int row, int col) const {
        return _data[2*row+col];
    }
    private:
    // store in single array
    // 0:->(0,0)
    // 1:->(0,1)
    // 2:->(1,0)
    // 3:->(1,1)
    double _data[4];
    };

Now, to use the ``Matrix22`` object, we can write:

.. code-block:: cpp

    Matrix22 mat;
    mat[0] = 1.0; //  assign the first element
    std::cout << "mat(0,0)=" << mat[0] << '\n';
    // the following style is extremely friendly to mathematicians
    // to under what we are doing.
    mat(1,1) = 2.0; // assign the last element
    std::cout << "mat(1,1)=" << mat(1,1) << '\n';

    // it's equiv to write
    mat.operator[](0) = 1;
    // and
    mat.operator()(1,1) = 2;

.. _lec6_adv_class_cmplx:

Reworked Version of ``ComplexNumber``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With the power of operator overloading, let's redo our ``ComplexNumber``
example. As what we did before, let's first structure out what functionalities
we need and decide what operators we want.

1. all arithmetic operations,
2. some assignment functionalities,
3. equal and not equal comparisons, and
4. enabling standard I/O operators.

We will extend these functionalities to ``ComplexNumber`` thus reviewing
:ref:`the interface <lec6_class_bs_cmplx>` if necessary.

Arithmetic Operations
`````````````````````

Given complex numbers :math:`z_1` and :math:`z_2`, and their corresponding
*Euler formers*, their product is defined as

.. math::

    z_1z_2&=(x_1x_2-y_1y_2)+(x_1y_2+y_1x_2)i

And their division, i.e. :math:`\frac{z_1}{z_2}`, is given by:

.. math::

    \frac{z_1}{z_2}&=\frac{z_1\bar{z_2}}{\left\vert z_2\right\vert^2}

Where :math:`\bar{z}` and :math:`\left\vert z\right\vert` are conjugate and
modulus, resp, of :math:`z`.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    // overload as free functions

    // addition and subtraction, directly calling the existing member
    // functions add/sub
    ComplexNumber operator+(const ComplexNumber &lhs, const ComplexNumber &rhs) {
        return lhs.add(rhs);
    }
    ComplexNumber operator-(const ComplexNumber &lhs, const ComplexNumber &rhs) {
        return lhs.sub(rhs);
    }

    // product
    ComplexNumber operator*(const ComplexNumber &lhs, const ComplexNumber &rhs) {
        // compute real part
        const double real = lhs.real()*rhs.real()-lhs.imag()*rhs.imag();
        // compute imag part
        const double imag = lhs.real()*rhs.imag()+lhs.imag()*rhs.real();
        return ComplexNumber(real, imag);
    }

    // division, this is important
    ComplexNumber operator/(const ComplexNumber &lhs, const ComplexNumber &rhs) {
        // compute lhs*conj(rhs) by calling * operator defined above
        const ComplexNumber top = lhs*rhs.conj();
        // compute bottom by calling modulus and square it
        double bot = rhs.modulus();
        // note, calling rhs.modulus() twice is expensive to do
        bot = bot*bot;
        // inverse it
        const double ibot = 1./bot;
        return top*ibot; // question, this is valid, but why?
    }

**Remark**: as you can see, the division is implemented by fully utilizing
what we have already implemented. Of course, you can expand the formula and
manually compute the real and imaginary parts (like the multiplication).
In line 24, the operator ``*``, which is defined in line 13) is called, and it
is called again in line 31 because implicitly casting from :code:`double` to
``ComplexNumber`` is allowed!

Assignments
```````````

Notice that assignments operators, including compound types, must be overloaded
as member functions.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    class ComplexNumber {
    public:
        // assignment
        ComplexNumber &operator=(const ComplexNumber &rhs) {
            copy(rhs);
            return *this; // don't forget this!
        }
        // plus assign
        ComplexNumber &operator+=(const ComplexNumber &rhs) {
            _real += rhs._real;
            _imag += rhs._imag;
            return *this;
        }
        // minus assign
        ComplexNumber &operator-=(const ComplexNumber &rhs) {
            _real -= rhs._real;
            _imag -= rhs._imag;
            return *this;
        }
    };

**Remark**: by :code:`return *this`, the chain reaction is enabled.

Comparisons
```````````

We will overload equal, i.e. ``==``, and not equal to, i.e. ``!=``, as free
functions.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    bool operator==(const ComplexNumber &lhs, const ComplexNumber &rhs) {
        return lhs.real() == rhs.real() && lhs.imag() == rhs.imag();
    }
    bool operator!=(const ComplexNumber &lhs, const ComplexNumber &rhs) {
        // return lhs.real() != rhs.real() || lhs.imag() != rhs.imag();
        // neat way
        return !(lhs == rhs);
    }

**Remark**: in line 7 above, the equal to operator that is defined in line 1 is
first called and returns a boolean value. We, then, apply the not operator
to the logical value in order to get its opposite, i.e. not equal to.

I/O Overloading
```````````````

Note that I/O must be overloaded as free functions. In general,
:code:`<iostream>` or equivalent headers should be included.

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::ostream & operator<<(std::ostream & out, const ComplexNumber &z) {
        // format is "real imag " w/o quotations
        out << z.real() << ' ' << z.imag() << ' ';
        return out;
    }
    std::istream & operator>>(std::istream & in, ComplexNumber &z) {
        // load real then imag
        in >> z.real() >> z.imag();
        return in;
    }

Summary
```````

Putting everything together, please take a look at our new ``ComplexNumber`` by
downloading the :ziplec_6:`complex_new` file.

.. _lec6_class_adv_inh:

Class Inheritance
-----------------

One of the important concept of class-based OOP language is the so-called
*class inheritance* relationships. This technique is typically used in the case
where two (or more) class types have a natural *child* and *parent* relation.

One of the main purpose of class inheritance is
*sharing common implementations*. Note that a parent can have multiple
children. To declare a class inheritance, we need to user inheritance symbol
``:``.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 8-9

    class Base {
    public:
        void base_method() const {
            std::cout << "base method\n";
        }
    };

    class Derived1 : public Base {};
    class Derived2 : public Base {};

Guess what, ``base_method`` is automatically enabled in both ``Derived1`` and
``Derived2``.

The ``public`` inheritance enables all the public members in ``Base`` and treat
them as ``public`` members in the derived classes.

.. note::

    Of course, there are other types of inheritances, but for this class, we
    only focus on ``public`` inheritance, which is the most commonly used one.

.. code-block:: cpp

    Derived1 d1;
    d1.base_method();
    Derived2 d2;
    d2.base_method();

Also, derived types can be passed as function arguments where the base type is
needed. i.e.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 10-11

    void call_base(const Base &obj) {
        // because base_method is constant member function
        // we can call it here.
        obj.base_method();
    }

    // in main.cpp
    Derived1 d1;
    Derived2 d2;
    call_base(d1);
    call_base(d2);

Accessing ``Base``'s Non-public Members
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's take a look at the following example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Parent {
    private:
        int _bank_acc;
    };

We define a ``Parent`` class that holds a ``_bank_acc`` member variable, now
you may think in order to get the information of the bank account, let's
define (or ... ;) pretend) to be a child of it. You probably think something
like this:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Child : public Parent {
    public:
        int get_bank_acc() const {
            return _bank_acc;
        }
    };

However, this does not work! **Derived classes cannot access private members
of the base class.**

.. important::

    Unlike Java, C#, and `Python`_, the OO inheritance in `C++`_ is very
    restricted and this, sometimes, can be a nice thing to have.

Clearly, ``private`` is not a right permission to have in order to allow
child classes to access non-public members. In this case, as
we :ref:`already mentioned <lec6_class_basis_access>` before, you need to use
``protected`` access specifier.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Parent {
    protected:
        int _bank_acc;
    };

Now, your "parent" allows you to his/her bank account ;)

Initializing Member Attributes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 5

    class MyInt {
    public:
        MyInt () { _v = 0; }
    private:
        int _v;
    };

Now, let's look at the simply class example above, especially line 3 and 5.
From line 3, we know that ``_v`` is already defined, otherwise, we cannot use
it. The question is **whether line 5 defines it?** The answer is **NO**, line
5 just simply **declares** that ``MyInt`` will hold an ``int``. So where is
``_v`` actually got defined?

It's got defined inside the constructor and this behavior is implicit. To
explicitly define the data attributes, we need to use the *initializer list*.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    class MyInt {
    public:
        MyInt() : _v(0) {}
    private:
        int _v;
    };

In this case, ``_v`` is calling the constructor ``int(int)`` in order to
define it with value 0.

Let's look at a more informative example, since ``int`` is too simple.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Object {
    public:
        Object() {
            std::cout << "default constructor\n";
        }
        Object(int a) {
            std::cout << "constructor with a=" << a << '\n';
        }
        Object(const std::string &str) {
            std::cout << "constructor with str: " << str << '\n';
        }
    };

Now, another family of objects ``Holder?``; each of them holds an ``Object``
instance.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // holder1 simply do nothing
    class Holder1 {
    public:
        Holder1() {}
    private:
        Object _obj;
    };

    // holder2 defines _obj with another constructor
    class Holder2 {
    public:
        Holder2() : _obj(1) {}
    private:
        Object _obj;
    };

    // holder3 defines _obj with the string constructor
    class Holder3 {
    public:
        Holder3() : _obj("ams562") {}
    private:
        Object _obj;
    };

The ``Guest`` Example
+++++++++++++++++++++

Let's consider the following example, a hotel wants to implement a simple
program that is able to computes the bill for customers given how many nights
they stay. The bill contains two parts 1) cost per night and 2) cost per
breakfast. By default, the prices are $150 and $20.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Guest {
    public:
        Guest(const std::string &name,
              const int nights) :
            _name(name),
            _nights(nights),
            _pri1(150.0f),
            _pri2(20.0f) {
            _type = "normal";
        }

        // get name
        const std::string &name() const { return _name; }

        // get how many nights this person has stayed
        int nights() const { return _nights; }

        // compute bill
        float compute_bill() const { return (_pri1+_pri2)*_nights; }

        const std::string &type() const { return _type; }
    private:
        std::string _name;
    protected:
        std::string _type; // customer type
        int _nights; // how many nights
        float _pri1; // cost per day
        float _pri2; // cost per meal
    };

Now, we can use the following example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    Guest g1("Foo Bar", 10);
    std::cout << "cost for g1 is $" << g1.compute_bill();

Of course, you may want to offer discounts for membership owners, say VIPs, who
are still considered as ``Guest``. For VIPs, your policy is $120 per day and
$10 for meals.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class VIP : public Guest {
    public:
        // call guest constructor in initializer list
        VIP(const std::string &name, const int nights) :
            Guest(name, nights) {
            // now pri1 = 150 and pri2 = 20
            // change them to the right ones for vip
            _pri1 = 120.0f;
            _pri2 = 10.0f;
            _type = "vip";
        }
    };

    // in main program
    VIP g2("Egg Spam", 20);
    std::cout << "cost for g2 is $" << g2.compute_bill();

Try this :nblec_6:`guest`.

Polymorphism
------------

.. note::

    This is an important concept for class-based OOP languages, but I will
    **not** test you explicitly on this part in homework and project
    assignments.

Let's keep considering the ``Guest`` example, assume that we now want to
create a special group of customers who take the advantage of the time limited
online offer. For these customers, the rule is that the total cost per day is
$100 including everything; moreover, an additional 10% discount will be
applied. Let's name this customer group to be ``SpecialGuest``.

Of course, the key difference is the ``compute_bill`` function, and you may
play tricks like assigning ``_pri2`` to 0 and ``_pri1`` to 90%x$100. But the
problem is that the code will become unreadable and to specialized.

A clean solution would be rewrite ``compute_bill``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    class SpecialGuest : public Guest {
    public:
    // call guest constructor in initializer list
    SpecialGuest(const std::string &name, const int nights) :
        Guest(name, nights) {
        // we don't care of _pri1 and _pri2 because we
        // will rewrite the function compute_bill
        _type = "special";
    }

    // rewrite compute bill with the special rule
    float compute_bill() const { return 90.0*_nights; }
    };

Now, let's :ref:`overload the output operator <lec6_adv_class_io>` in order to
have a clean interface:

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::ostream & operator << (std::ostream &out, const Guest &g) {
        std::cout <<
            g.name() << ", " <<
            g.type() << ", " <<
            g.nights() << ", total: $" <<
            g.compute_bill() << '\n';
    }

In the main program, you have a ``SpecialGuest`` named Joe,

.. code-block:: cpp

    SpecialGuest g("Joe", 10);
    std::cout << g;

What you expected is probably:

.. code-block:: console

    Jeo, special, 10, total: $900.0

But what you get is actually:

.. code-block:: console

    Jeo, special, 10, total: $1700.0

So Joe is not a special guest! What is the problem?

The issue is that the output operator (or in general any functions) takes
``Guest`` as input type. Therefore, when you call ``compute_bill`` inside
the function body, i.e. the code block above, the actual version you invoke
is the one of ``Guest``.

To overcome this limitation, you need to use the so-called *virtual functions*
or utilize the *polymorphism* technique in `C++`_. This requires us to rework
the ``Guest``.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 19

    class Guest {
    public:
        Guest(const std::string &name,
              const int nights) :
            _name(name),
            _nights(nights),
            _pri1(150.0f),
            _pri2(20.0f) {
            _type = "normal";
        }

        // get name
        const std::string &name() const { return _name; }

        // get how many nights this person has stayed
        int nights() const { return _nights; }

        // compute bill
        virtual float compute_bill() const { return (_pri1+_pri2)*_nights; }

        const std::string &type() const { return _type; }
    private:
        std::string _name;
    protected:
        std::string _type; // customer type
        int _nights; // how many nights
        float _pri1; // cost per day
        float _pri2; // cost per meal
    };

In line 19, the keyword ``virtual`` is to indicate that member function
``compute_bill`` can, potentially, be *ovrride* in its child classes.

Now, in the ``SpecialGuest``, we can have:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 12-14

    class SpecialGuest : public Guest {
    public:
    // call guest constructor in initializer list
    SpecialGuest(const std::string &name, const int nights) :
        Guest(name, nights) {
        // we don't care of _pri1 and _pri2 because we
        // will rewrite the function compute_bill
        _type = "special";
    }

    // rewrite compute bill with the special rule
    virtual float compute_bill() const override {
        return 90.0*_nights;
    }
    };

.. note::

    ``virtual`` specifier in derived classes is not needed, but it provides
    a clearer interface. ``override`` can only be used in derived classes and
    it's also optional, but having it makes the code clearer.

If you ``cout`` Joe this time, you will get the desired output. In practice,
polymorphism is an extremely useful technique. But since it involves many
advanced understanding of `C++`_, I will not go into details for this class.
