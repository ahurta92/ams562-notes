# Intro to Scientific Computing with C++, Lecture Notes

This repository contains the lecture notes for course [AMS562 *Intro to Scientific Computing with C++*](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ams/graduate/_courses/ams562.php) at Stony Brook University. The lecture notes are written with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html); [lyx](https://www.lyx.org/) (version 2.2.3) is used for the lecture slides.

## Coding Environment

As this course targets students who are interested in *scientific programming*, Linux system is assumed to be the teaching environment. We have been providing Linux environment through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers since last year (2017),and each of those containers comes with a light-weight desktop environment (no need to worry about using the terminal). The Docker setting allows us to provide students a unified programming environment. To further simplify the workflow with Docker, a Python-based driver script is provided in order to easily run, mount, and create the desktop environment in browser with Docker command.

***NEW*** Starting this year (2018), a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) based environment is provided so that students can test their codes without worrying about compilation.

For more detailed information regarding how to use the Docker image, please check [ams562-desktop](https://github.com/compdatasci/ams562-desktop).
