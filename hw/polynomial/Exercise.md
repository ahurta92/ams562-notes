# Exercises

For the following begin by creating an executable using
`Cmake` or `Make`


## 1. Polynomial

Write a class for polynomials that should at least contain:

- A constructor giving the degree of the polynomial;
- A dynamic array/vector/list of double to store the coefficients
- A destructor; and
- A output function for ostream

## Move Assignment

- Write a move assignment operator for the polynomial class.
- Define a copy constructor as **default**.
- Test whether your assignment is used to write a function
  polynomial `f(double c2,double c1,double c0)` takes three
  coefficients and returns a polynomial.
- Print out a message in your move assignment or use a debugger to
  make sure that the move assignment is used.

## Initializer List

- Expand the program with a constructor and an assignment operator for a intializer list.
- The degree of the polynomial should be the length of the initializer list minus one afterward.
